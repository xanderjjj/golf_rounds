# Golf Rounds

If you have several rounds of golf to play with a big group, how do you assign a game roster to minimise the number of times each player plays with another?

In short... I dunno! `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

So what I did was wrote some code to randomly assign players in a roster then check the number of repeats. By running this hundreds of thousands of times we can find a somewhat good solution.

I have included the code and my results for 5 round rosters.

Note: Given the random nature of this approach the generated outcomes are by no means optimal, but are probably close enough to use.

```
      '\                   .  .                        |>18>>
        \              .         ' .                   |
       O>>         .                 'o                |
        \       .                                      |
        /\    .                                        |
       / /  .'                                         |
 ^^^^^^^^^^`^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
